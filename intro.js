// the beginning - 2009 rayan dahl's 
// in 2009 a software engineer named rayan dahl from the us created node.js


// at that time 

// javaScript was only used  in browsefer
// - servers were built using php,python or java 
//  each request on the server would create a new thread  consuming memeor and slowing thins down under heavy load 

// rayan found this inefficient especially after seeing how web browser handle  asynchronous even (non blocking operation

// he wanted the same non -blocking behavior on the server )
// that how Node,js was born to bring javscript to the backend but in a faster and more scable way  



// the core idea - event driven & non - blocking i/o

// rayan built Node.js using 

// google v8 engine (the same engine that powers chrome )
// libuv (a c libaray for asynchrouns i/)

// this combination allowed Node.js to 
// handle many request at once using a single thread 
// avoid blocking while waitng for task like file reading or database queries 

// in short 

// early days (2009 - 2011) 
// 2009 node js was    realsed at jsconf eu conference 
// 2010 npm (note package manger ) was introuced - the game changer

// developers could easliy install and share reusable  package 

// 2001 companies like linkind and uber started using Node.js for their backends due to its speed and scalanity 

// example 
//  linkeind moved from ruby rail to node js and saw their server handle 10x more traffic wich fewer machines 


// rise in popularity (2012- 2015)
// node rapidly become go =to choice for building 
// . api 
// .real - time application (chat live updates)
// .command line tools
// developer utiles 

// Big companies joined 

// .Netflix(for streaming)
// .paypal (for faster apis)
// . eBay walmart amd nasa adopted node.js in production 


// however.around 2014 there was community tension- deveopment was slow and contributors were fusrated 



// ------------------------------------
// Today echosystem 
// . over 2 millon + package on npm 
// . used by 90% + morden web developer 
// .foundation for frameworks like express .js fastify and adonisJs  

// its no longer "just javaScript on the server - 
// its a backbone" of thr modern web connecting api microservies and tools
